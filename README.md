# PathFinder

A path finding algorithm visualizer application built using C# and .Net framework 4.7.2. 
This application allows you to choose from various path finding algorithms like A* (with 
Euclidean and Manhattan distance), Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-first search, Depth-first 
search, etc. and visualize the steps taken by each algorithm to find the path from the 
starting cell to the end cell on a grid.

## Features

* Visualization of different path finding algorithms
* Ability to set obstacles, walls, for the environment
* Generation of various mazes
* Addition of a middle point between the start and end points
* Highlighting of the cells that been visited and the shortest path found

## Prerequisites

* Windows operating system
* .Net framework 4.7.2 or higher
* Visual Studio 2017 or higher

## Getting Started

1. Download the source code from the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the solution
